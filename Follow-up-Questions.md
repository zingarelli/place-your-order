# How long did you spend on the test?

I've spent 9 hours on the test. Approximately 3 hours of this time were dedicated to learn the basics of Jest framework.

# What would you add if you had more time?

I'd add styles to create a mobile version of the application (the layout looks good in screens with at least 480 pixels wide). 

I'd also refactor the code to have better state management (right now I use "prop drilling" to pass data between components), and with that, I could create more (and have a better coverage of) tests. But I lack the knowledge for doing so.

# How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?

The API could also provide an image to each product, or at least an URL to get such image. It would also be nice if there was a section in the image showing the promotions available for a product.

# What did you find most difficult?

Testing. It's something new to me and I don't have much practice in creating tests and using Jest framework. That's why the tests I created were simple (more related to what's being rendered in the screen). 

I've also had problems with passing data between components. The approach I used would not perform well in a large-scale application. There are better ways of managing React State data, using for example React Context, Redux or Recoil, but I still need to learn them.

# How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?

I think this challenge covered very well several concepts related to Front End development: communication with external API, creation of components and layouts, coding of business rules and application of unit tests. It was a great experience to test my knowledge and also point where I still need to improve. 

It would be nice if a layout for the application (a Figma file, for example) were provided.
